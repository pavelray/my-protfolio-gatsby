## Prologue:
So after many unsuccessful plans, finally we made this one successful. This year(2017) when we started planning for this trip, our head count was around 7-8 but only 3 of us (my wife, my brother and me) made it. My wife and me started our trip on 11th August. It was Friday, a long weekend was knocking at the door and as expected Bangalore traffic was too much in the evening. We planned to leave home by 6 pm but due to high traffic, we got our cab 30 mins later. We were afraid that we might miss our flight which was at 8:55 pm. After requesting the cab driver so many times to drive fast, we reached the airport sharp at 8 pm. Luckily there was no crowed at boarding but as we were the last person to check in, we did not get seat together. Anyways, thanks to God that we did not miss the flight,since there are many stories of people who frequently miss their flights due to Bangalore high traffic and we didn't want to experience the same and that too on Ladakh trip! :o

**Note :** I read many articles and watched many videos regarding high altitude sickness at Leh and specially Khardungla, from my experience I (smoke every day) felt very little breathing problem while walking which is similar to any mountain places, there was nothing more in Leh and Khardungla. We traveled by flight but didn't feel any headache after landing and throughout our trip. The Climate is very dry there, so don't get dehydrated, drink water as much as possible.

Our trip was 10 days and 9 nights. Total cost was Rs. 22000 per head, including food and all transport (excluding flight tickets)
